To run this demo having ska3 installed as described in https://github.com/sot/skare3/wiki/Ska3-runtime-environment-for-usersska helps but is not necessary, 
having tensorflow and keras(simple pip install) installed + jupyter notebook is a must. 

To use tensorflow follow instructions here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip
follow instructions related to creating a virtual environment with conda which can be the same 
environment as ska3 here: https://github.com/sot/skare3/wiki/Ska3-runtime-environment-for-usersska is also needed

You will know that tensorflow is properly installed if you can run the command "import tensorflow as tf" from your jupyter notebook as well as 
running "from keras import backend" you get the message "Using Tensorflow backend"
