# Objectives

An equilibrium database would make it quick and easy for users to look at the thermal profiles of the spacecraft subsystems(with emphasis on HRMA, OBA + SIM) at given positions. Looking at these profiles users should understand how pitch, duration and other positional factors affect temperature of components. 
The smart anomaly detection will use past thermal profiles to build models and with every new telemetry pass answer the question: does something not make sense. If it finds that there are thermal anomalies then the user should be notified and given a sense of where things went wrong. 

# Latest Models:

HRMA Avg. Temp, MSID= 4OAVHRMT
